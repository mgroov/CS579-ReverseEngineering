# Easy Crackmes 

## easycrackme.1 

Easy crackme 1 consisted of a single executable. When ran it prompts the user for a password. In order to find out this password I ran strings and noticed an unusual string. picklecucumber1337, given that this string contains 1337 or leet I tried this as a potential password and it worked. 


## easycrackme.2

Easy crackme 2 was similair to easycrackme1. Once again running strings in a similair place to easycrackme1 I also saw a string that was unlikely to be a standard function call. artificialtree , Trying this password cracked the crackme.


## easycrackme.3 

Easy crackme 3 was also in a similair executable to easy crackme 1 and 2. When running strings on the file a string strawberry appeared however, trying yielded a fail result from the crackme.
